# ðŸŒŒ Astro-Recognizer  
An end-to-end image classification model covering data collection, cleaning, model training, deployment, and API integration.  

---

## The model classifies 17 different types of astronomical elements:  

### Galaxies & Nebulae  
> **These celestial wonders contain billions of stars, gas, and dust, shaping the grand structure of the universe.**  

| Name                |
|---------------------|
| Andromeda Galaxy   |
| Milky Way Galaxy   |
| Triangulum Galaxy  |
| Crab Nebula        |
| Eagle Nebula       |
| Orion Nebula       |

---

### Planets  
> **Planets orbit stars, with some potentially harboring life. Each has unique atmospheres and compositions.**  

| Name      |
|----------|
| Earth    |
| Jupiter  |
| Mars     |
| Mercury  |
| Neptune  |
| Saturn   |
| Uranus   |
| Venus    |

---

### Others  
> **Mysterious cosmic objects, from collapsed stars to planetary bodies beyond our solar system.**  

| Name           |
|---------------|
| Black Holes   |
| Exoplanets    |
| Supernova Remnants |

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Preparation  
âœ… **Data Collection:** Images were sourced from DuckDuckGo using search terms.  
âœ… **DataLoader:** Fastai's `DataBlock API` was used to set up the DataLoader.  
âœ… **Data Augmentation:** Fastai's built-in GPU-optimized augmentation was applied.  

ðŸ“Œ **Details available in** [`notebooks/data_prep.ipynb`](notebooks/data_prep.ipynb)  

---

## Model Training & Data Cleaning  
 **Training:** Fine-tuned a `ResNet-34` model over 5 epochs (8 times), achieving **~86% accuracy**.  
 **Data Cleaning:** Since data was collected from the web, noise removal was crucial. The `ImageClassifierCleaner` tool from Fastai was used iteratively after each training cycle, except for the final iteration.

## Model Deployment  
The trained model is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** using Gradio.  

ðŸ“Œ **Implementation:** [`deployment/`](deployment/)  
ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [Hugging Face App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nosttradamus/astro-recognizer)
